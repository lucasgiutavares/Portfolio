# Machine Learning Projects

## Time Series Classification Models

MSc dissertation based on Time Series Classification on Aviation.
Two articles have been submitted and are being analyzed, which makes it not possible to publish more details here.
One dataset published [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.21227/k10b-qn21)

## Time Series Classification Models

Online Learning algorithm.
Different successful models were built to predict B3 Stock Market data.
Used Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Dollar, and Euronext 100 data from Yahoo Finance API.
Predicted 1% or more uphill events with 88% Precision.

## Logistic Regression Model - Final Paper (Rio de Janeiro  University)

This work was presented as a requisite for Graduation in Physical Education in poster format.
I was the co-advisor of this work and used R for the statistical analysis and data assembling and cleaning.

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In this Kaggle Competition, a model was made for predicting who would die from the Titanic Disaster.
R was used in the entire process.

The final model used Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, choosing the model with the best accuracy on training for final prediction. The model achieved a 77% Kaggle Accuracy.

## House Prices Prediction

In this Kaggle Competition, a model was made for predicting the prices of houses in Aimes, Iowa.
R was used on the entire process with Hmisc, FSelector, e1071, and RandomForest packages.

Random Forest was used for feature selection and linear regression for final prediction. The final model achieved an RSME of 0.16534.

## Data Collection and Report - Information and Methodological Support Center (CIAM - Fluminense Football Club)

The objective of this work was to report on the soccer performance of the main Brazillian Clubs Academies in the last 5 years.
Here I used Excel and MS PowerPoint.
