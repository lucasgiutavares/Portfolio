# Machine Learning Projects

## Time Series Classification Models

MSc dissertation based on Time Series Classification on Aviation.
Two articles have been submitted and are being analysed, which makes not possible to publish more details here.
One dataset published [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.21227/k10b-qn21)

## Time Series Classification Models

Online Learning algorithm.
Different successfull models built to predict B3 Stock Market data.
Used Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Dollar and Euronext 100 data from Yahoo Finance API.
Predicted 1% or more uphill events with 88% Precision.

## Logistic Regression Model - Final Paper (Rio de Janeiro  University)

This work was presented as a requisite for Graduation in Physical Education in poster format.
I was the co-advisor of this work and used R for the statistical analysis and data assembling and cleaning.

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In this Kaggle Competition a model was made for predicting who would die from Titanic Disaster.
R was used on the entire proccess.

The final model used Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, chosing the model with the best accuracy on training for final prediction. The model achieved 77% Kaggle Accuracy.

## House Prices Prediction

In this Kaggle Competition a model were made for predicting the prices of houses in Aimes, Iowa.
R was used on the entire proccess with Hmisc, FSelector, e1071 and RandomForest packages.

Random Forest was used for feature selection and linear regression for final prediction. The final model achieved a RSME of 0.16534.

## Data Collection and Report - Information and Methodological Support Center (CIAM - Fluminense Football Club)

The objective of this work was to give a report on soccer performance of the main Brazillian Clubs Academies on the last 5 years.
Here I used Excel and MS Power Point.
