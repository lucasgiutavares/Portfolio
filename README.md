## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In this Kaggle Competition a model is made for predicting who would die from Titanic Disaster.
R was used on the entire proccess and produced Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine models for prediction.

The final model used Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, chosing the model with the best accuracy on training for final prediction. The model achieved 77% Kaggle Accuracy.

## House Prices Prediction

In this Kaggle Competition a model were made for predicting the prices of houses in Aimes, Iowa.
R was used on the entire proccess with Hmisc, FSelector, e1071 and RandomForest packages.

Random Forest was used for feature selection and linear regression for final prediction. The final model achieved a RSME of 0.16534.

## Data Collection and Report - Information and Methodological Support Center (CIAM - Fluminense Football Club)

The objective of this work was to give a report on soccer performance of the main Brazillian Clubs on the last 5 years.
Here I used Excel and MS Power Point.
